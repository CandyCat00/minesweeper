# Overview

This a program that lets the use play minesweeper in the terminal.

I created this to test the basics I had been leaning in Kotlin. It's not perfect yet, and probably could use some clean up, but once I learn more I will probably add to it in the future

# Future Work

Things I will add later:
* A seperate screen with actual graphics
* A file the user can save their game to and load their game from.
* Debugging the checkEmptyAdjacent() function to work 100%
* Debugging the inputs so that they don't crash the program when the input is invalid.
